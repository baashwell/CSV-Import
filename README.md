Java Refresh CSV Importing


Training project for Maven and Visual Studio Code.

1) Installation and Git Link

Installing VSC, JDK, JRE, GIT and Maven is all simple enough ensuring that you add the correct PATH values. Git integration with VSC can be done via using the standalone GIT Bash shell to pull down projects, edit the repository and use the shell to push again.

I have choose to pull using VSC via opening the command window (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and entering Git Clone, followed by the URL and then the location to store the repository. All of this is assuming you have installed the Visual Studio Team Services add on.

Commit and Pushing can then be done via the Version control system within VSC, although not on the WIFI in Fenchurch Street office. Firstly, save the file you are working on and stage it (right click stage), once staged on the version control tab press the tick to commit changes and then at the bottom right hand corner you can press arrow button to push changes.
